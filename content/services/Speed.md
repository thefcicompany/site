A bosonic ground state of a system of electrons is trivial to find; they would attach to the most electropositive atom centre in the system, and become a condensate. Unfortunately for us, electrons are fermions and cannot occupy the same state - they experience fermi pressure to spread out, occupying higher energy states and generating chemical structures we can use.

The central difficulty of full configuration interaction calculations is solving the sign problem. By using the 28.8Tb/s bisection bandwidth of the Intel Stratix 10 FPGA rack-scale cluster, we can explore the space of trial solutions fundamentally faster than classical CPU or GPU based systems can.
