We strive for the highest standards of accuracy for both our product and our process.

Delivering full configuration interaction levels of theory offers insight into the fundamental interactions within your system of interest; and we will compose wonderfully with QC/MM toolkits to offer accuracy on demand.

Further, we follow the highest development standards to deliver reliable results. From formal model checking in Alloy, property testing with Hypothesis and the use of the correct-by-construction languages Bluespec and Rust, we aim to deliver highly performing tools on time.
